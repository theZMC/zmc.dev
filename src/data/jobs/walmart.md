I was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the deparments I managed. I
managed a staff of 10-15 employees, including hiring, training, and scheduling.
I was also responsible for managing my portions of the store's budget, including
payroll, inventory, and expenses. I had anywhere from 2 to 5 department managers
reporting to me, depending on my assigned departments. I was responsible for
their training and development as well as for merchandising and maintaining the
appearance of their departments.
