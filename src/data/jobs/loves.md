I was responsible for the day-to-day operations of a 24-hour travel stop. I was
responsible for managing a staff of 20-30 employees, including hiring, training,
and scheduling. I was also responsible for managing the store's budget,
including payroll, inventory, and expenses. I had ~10 managerial direct reports,
including assistant managers, shift leaders, and profit-center managers and I
was responsible for their training and development.
