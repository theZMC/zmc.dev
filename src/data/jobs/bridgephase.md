At BridgePhase, I'm contracted with the Air Force to work on Big Bang, an
open-source implementation of the DoD's DevSecOps reference architecture. I've
worked on multiple mission teams, including the Observability and Service Mesh
teams. Most of the day-to-day involved maintaining the implementation itself,
with the majority of hands-on-keyboard work centered on creating and maintaining
helm charts. In addition to this core duty, I also helped steer the project,
identified and implemented process improvements, provided feedback to the
government stakeholders, and assisted end-users with installing and using the
project.
