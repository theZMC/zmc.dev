I was a member of the infrastructure team and I was primarily tasked with caring
for the runtime environments of many external and internal applications,
consisting of Tomcat and WebSphere servers running on a mix of AIX and RHEL
hosts on Power 9 hardware. I was also one of the key team-members responsible
for maintaining the company's ecommerce platform. Between these duties, I helped
automate the company's migration process from CVS to Git and spent a great deal
of time working with CI/CD pipelines on our internal Gitlab instance. I also
developed helm charts and build pipelines for our internal Openshift
environment, mainly focused on the logging and observability stacks.
