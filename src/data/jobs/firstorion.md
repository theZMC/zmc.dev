I worked in the R&D department with a team of engineers to build new products
and features for our customers. The day-to-day technologies changed often and I
was given the freedom to explore new technologies for our projects. Most of
these were written in Go and made heavy use of Kubernetes and AWS. In addition
to those projects, I created a polyglot notebook application that glues together
Netflix's polynote project with Databricks for easier data-engineering
workflows. On my team, I'm known as the unblocker for my ability to troubleshoot
quickly. I've also put a lot of effort into improving team tooling for
productivity and I've written several scripts to automate setting up a new
developer's environment.
