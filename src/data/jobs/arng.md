I was a combat medic in the Arkansas Army National Guard. My primary focus at
all times was the medical readiness of my unit. I assisted with the training and
development of my unit's medics and I was responsible for the medical reporting
of other medics in my section during field operations. During garrison
operations, I was responsible for maintaining the unit's medical equipment and
supplies.
